# MarchBot

MarchBot is a small bot for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) which posts the number of days since March 1st of 2020 in the reference frame of an imaginary calendar where March simply never ends.

When writing this bot, I had a few particular outcomes in mind:

* A social commentary on the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* A practical excuse for me to get more familiar with the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/).
* Learning to interact with the Fediverse programatically.

However please note that this code is very simple, and takes a number of shortcuts and tradeoffs that may not be appropriate in your context.
